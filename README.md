# miniTCG

A very basic automated Trading Card Game Application written in PHP. 
miniTCG is using Bootstrap 4 for styling and FontAwesome for icons.

(Because of the DSGVO you should consider hosting Bootstrap and the FontAwesome iconfont yourself!)

*Note that this is a german project, so files will contain german text elements!*

**The Application is still under development!**
