<h1>New Page</h1>

<!--
	This page does not have a specifically defined route!
	
	Views within the "pages" folder can be accessed using a default route, sending the request to PagesController->view().
	
		PRO: you don't have to mess with the controller
		CON: you can't use Routes::getUri() to link to these pages.
